# Hangin Man

## Python Laboratory

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a classic word-guessing game where your goal is to guess the secret word one letter at a time. If you guess a letter correctly, it will be revealed in the word. But be careful, each wrong guess brings you one step closer to being "hanged."

## How to Play

1. Start the Game: Trigger the game by clicking the 'Play' button located at the top-right corner of your IDE interface.
2. Terminal Interaction: The game will run in your terminal, where you'll receive all the necessary instructions.
3. Make Your Guess: You will be prompted to guess a letter. Type in your guess and press 'Enter'.
4. Feedback:
   - Correct Guess: For each correct guess, you'll see a thumbs-up emoji (üëç) as positive reinforcement.
   - Incorrect Guess: Each incorrect guess will gradually reveal the hangman figure. Be cautious, as too many wrong guesses will lead to a game over.
5. Alerts: When you're down to your last guess, an alert message will inform you that it's your final chance to save the hangman.
6. Game Over: Failing to guess the word correctly will result in a 'GAME OVER' message, and the secret word will be revealed.
7. Victory: If you successfully guess the word, you'll receive a congratulatory message along with the revealed word.

   Enjoy the game, and may your guesses be shrewd!
